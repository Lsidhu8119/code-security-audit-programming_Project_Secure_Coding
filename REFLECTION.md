## Can I explain what my code does?
- A programming language survey form that gathers user data, preferences, and skill implemented by me in this code. In order to make sure that users submit accurate information, it has validation for required fields and formats like emails,name and many more. After validation is done successfully, the form is uploaded to https://httpbin.org/post.

## What was my coding process?
- I started by describing the form's layout and the fields that must be filled in for it to properly collect data. The JavaScript implementation of the validation ensure clarity  to provide a user-friendly experience. By dividing my work into sections for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I made it easy to solve any problemand make changes.

## What challenges did I have?
- Making sure every input field had validation, which included  using the right formats was one of the challenging task for me . I overcame this by testing each validation many times  and making sure it is working well untill it matched my project specifications.

## What would I do differently now?
- If I get a chance to  start over, I might learn a front-end framework like React.js to make form handling and validation easier and the code more maintainable. To improve the user experience, I will definitely add  real-time validation feedback that will make sure users fix mistakes as they fill out the form.
